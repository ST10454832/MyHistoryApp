***Assignment report:***

**Purpose**

Sarah, a close family member requests for an application, she requests an application where a user inputs an age and that will generate a historical figure who passed on at that age.

The purpose of this application is to display historical figures at a specific age.

**Design Considerations**



**Intuitive Design**

The layout is straightforward to understand, with simplicity that facilitates navigation and usage. It adheres to UX/UI design principles, ensuring alignment with user requirements, a well-defined hierarchy, and appropriate contextual elements.

**Content Prioritization**

Indeed, the application incorporates all vital interface components, serving as the foundation for usability and responsiveness. Users can seamlessly engage with the displayed content, which holds crucial information aligned with their intended purposes.

**Legible Text Content** 

I opted for Roboto italics for its elegance and readability. While the application contains extensive text, each font choice is tailored to enhance readability and context relevance. Roboto is specifically employed for Text View, given its role in conveying meaningful information.

Bold white text is consistently applied to buttons and prompts, notably for user input prompts like "enter age," highlighting their importance and soliciting user engagement.

As previously stated, the app adheres to straightforward design principles, prioritizing functionality, and user-friendliness to ensure a seamless and pleasant user experience.




**Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible**

Adequate padding, spacing, and indentations are present within the app, ensuring a visually balanced layout. Bold outlines delineate various elements, while sufficient space is allocated to showcase all app functionalities effectively.

The app boasts a clean user interface that avoids user confusion and appropriately emphasizes the context of its use without overshadowing it.

**Hand Position Control**

Indeed, the interface features just two buttons, distinguished by vivid colours and bold text that succinctly outlines their respective functions. These buttons operate flawlessly, addressing warnings and user prompts with minimal errors, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Images**

Since the application necessitates user input of an age to reveal a historical figure, corresponding images of those figures are selected. These images are then paired with information about the respective figure to visually showcase their identity and significance.

Sample of a test class using JUnit:

import org.junit.Assert.\*

import org.junit.Test

class MyUnitTest {

@Test

fun testWhenStatement() {

// Test case for a when statement

val result = when (25) {

21 -> "Some Body, famous for …, died at this age" // use your own wording (copy from your code) – only need 3 ages from your code for the test here.

34 -> "Another Some Body, famous for ……., died at this age"

63 -> "Someone Else, famous for …..., died at this age"

else -> "Nobody famous known to me died at this age"

}

assertEquals("Nobody famous known to me died at this age", result)

}

}
